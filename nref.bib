abstract = {With the ever-evolving concerns on privacy protection, vertical federated learning
(FL), where participants own non-overlapping features for the same set of instances,
is becoming a heated topic since it enables multiple enterprises to strengthen the
machine learning models collaboratively with privacy guarantees. Nevertheless, to
achieve privacy preservation, vertical FL algorithms involve complicated training
routines and time-consuming cryptography operations, leading to slow training speed.This
paper explores the efficiency of the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm
under the vertical FL setting. Specifically, we introduce VF^2Boost, a novel and efficient
vertical federated GBDT system. Significant solutions are developed to tackle the
major bottlenecks. First, to handle the deficiency caused by frequent mutual-waiting
in federated training, we propose a concurrent training protocol to reduce the idle
periods. Second, to speed up the cryptography operations, we analyze the characteristics
of the algorithm and propose customized operations. Empirical results show that our
system can be 12.8-18.9 times faster than the existing vertical federated implementations
and support much larger datasets.},

abstract = {With the ever-evolving concerns on privacy protection, vertical federated learning
(FL), where participants own non-overlapping features for the same set of instances,
is becoming a heated topic since it enables multiple enterprises to strengthen the
machine learning models collaboratively with privacy guarantees. Nevertheless, to
achieve privacy preservation, vertical FL algorithms involve complicated training
routines and time-consuming cryptography operations, leading to slow training speed.This
paper explores the efficiency of the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm
under the vertical FL setting. Specifically, we introduce VF^2Boost, a novel and efficient
vertical federated GBDT system. Significant solutions are developed to tackle the
major bottlenecks. First, to handle the deficiency caused by frequent mutual-waiting
in federated training, we propose a concurrent training protocol to reduce the idle
periods. Second, to speed up the cryptography operations, we analyze the characteristics
of the algorithm and propose customized operations. Empirical results show that our
system can be 12.8-18.9 times faster than the existing vertical federated implementations
and support much larger datasets.},

abstract="We initiate the cryptographic study of order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPE), a primitive suggested in the database community by Agrawal et al. (SIGMOD '04) for allowing efficient range queries on encrypted data. Interestingly, we first show that a straightforward relaxation of standard security notions for encryption such as indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is unachievable by a practical OPE scheme. Instead, we propose a security notion in the spirit of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and related primitives asking that an OPE scheme look ``as-random-as-possible'' subject to the order-preserving constraint. We then design an efficient OPE scheme and prove its security under our notion based on pseudorandomness of an underlying blockcipher. Our construction is based on a natural relation we uncover between a random order-preserving function and the hypergeometric probability distribution. In particular, it makes black-box use of an efficient sampling algorithm for the latter.",

Recent studies revealed that adversaries can `steal’ deployed models even when they have no training samples and can not get access to the model parameters or structures. Currently, there were some defense methods to alleviate this threat, mostly by increasing the cost of model stealing. In this paper, we explore the defense from another angle by verifying whether a suspicious model contains the knowledge of defender-specified external features. Specifically, we embed the external features by tempering a few training samples with style transfer. We then train a meta-classifier to determine whether a model is stolen from the victim. This approach is inspired by the understanding that the stolen models should contain the knowledge of features learned by the victim model. We examine our method on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously, even if the stolen model is obtained via a multi-stage stealing process. The codes for reproducing main results are available at Github (https://github.com/zlh-thu/StealingVerification).}, number={2}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Li, Yiming and Zhu, Linghui and Jia, Xiaojun and Jiang, Yong and Xia, Shu-Tao and Cao, Xiaochun}, year={2022}, month={Jun.}, pages={1464-1472} }

abstract="This paper studies the security of SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 against collision attacks and provides some insight into the security properties of the basic building blocks of the structure. It is concluded that neither Chabaud and Joux's attack, nor Dobbertin-style attacks apply. Differential and linear attacks also don't apply on the underlying structure. However we show that slightly simplified versions of the hash functions are surprisingly weak : whenever symmetric constants and initialization values are used throughout the computations, and modular additions are replaced by exclusive or operations, symmetric messages hash to symmetric digests. Therefore the complexity of collision search on these modified hash functions potentially becomes as low as one wishes.",

The higher-level protocols offer integer truncation and comparison, which are typically the main performance bottlenecks in complex applications. We present techniques and building blocks that allow to improve the efficiency of these protocols, in order to meet the performance requirements of a broader range of applications. The protocols can be constructed using different secure computation methods. We focus on solutions for multiparty computation using secret sharing.",

abstract = {In the training process of distributed machine learning, the data possessed at distinct companies usually contain different features. Labels may even be lacked at certain companies. Therefore, one option is that multiple companies perform joint training in the form of federated learning (FL). Existing studies on FL confines to traditional machine learning (ML), including linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree. In this work, vertical federated learning is extended from traditional ML to deep neural networks (DNN). A privacy-preserving DNN model training scheme based on homomorphic encryption is proposed for vertically segmented datasets. It is shown that the proposed federated DNN scheme can achieve similar precision as that of the traditional centralized DNN scheme.}
